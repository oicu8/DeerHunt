I'll give you the most used parameters, and let you change them if you want. Any command written here is optional, and you can start playing now just by using `dh!add_channel`.

**Before starting, please make sure this is the channel you want to use, and activate it with `dh!add_channel`.**

**1/ Language used**:
    \* If you speak french, use `dh!settings set language fr_FR`
    \* If you speak spanish, use `dh!settings set language es_ES`
    \* Another language we don't fully support yet? Help us translate DeerHunt! Find us at https://discord.gg/.
    
**2/ Deer Per Day**:
    This is the number of deer that will spawn per day. They spawn at random intervals, but you can configure the number of deer that will spawn.
    \* Use the following command to change it, use `dh!settings set deer_per_day XX`, where `XX` is a number.
    \* To prevent abuse, there is a limit that will be automatically enforced. If you need to lift it, contact my owner at the support server.
    
**3/ Exp Won Per Deer Killed**:
    This is the experience won per deer killed. If your server is really popular, it might be worth it to push it up a little to make new hunters progress faster.
    \* Use the following command to change it, use `dh!settings set exp_won_per_deer_killed XX`, where `XX` is a number.
    \* :bulb: Don't go too high tho, there must be some challenge. 15 is a good start
    
**4/ Other settings**:
    This is starting to be lengthy, so I won't go into further details here. You are probably all set and can start the game by typing `dh!add_channel`.
    More settings can be found using `dh!settings list`
    
Thanks for playing with me! <:official_Deer_01:439546719177539584>
