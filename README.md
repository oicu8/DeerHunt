# DeerHunt
## What is it?
The core of the game is to shoot every deer you see. Like a shooter, just for discord! :Â°)

## I need help. Where can I get it?
[You should check out our website](https://deerhunt.me). Every command, setting and item is documented there.

## I want to use the bot on my server. How can I add it?
There are two possible ways to use the bot. You can either simply invite the official version, or host it yourself (advanced users only).

### Invite link (Official Version)
1. [Click here to invite the bot](https://)
2. Claim your own server using `!claimserver`
3. Go to a channel you want to hunt in
4. Add the channel to the list of channels deer appear in with `!add_channel`
5. That's it! You should check out the settings list [here](https://deerhunt.me/bot-settings/) for information on how to tweak the bot.

### Self-Hosting the bot
[Installation Instructions](INSTALL.md)

## I still need help. What do I do?

If you need help or have any questions, feel free to join [our discord](https://discord.gg/).
